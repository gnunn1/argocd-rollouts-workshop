### OpenShift Argo Rollouts Workshop

#### Introduction

This workshop provides an Argo Rollouts 101 experience on OpenShift using the OpenShift
GitOps operator. It walks workshop attendees through the process of using blue-green
and canary strategies with Rollouts as well as automated testing using Analysis.

#### Installation

This workshop is available in the Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP) for Red Hat employees and partners. It can however be installed manually:

* Provision OpenShift Workshop 4.14 instance in RHDP with the desired number of users
* Login on the command line as the `admin` user with the credentials RHDP provided
* Modify `bootstrap/bootstrap/ansible/bootstrap.yaml` to set the number of users you need, this must match the number of users selected in RHDP
* Run the command `./bootstrap/bootstrap.sh`

Note that the installation is using ansible so you must have ansible installed on your system along with the requirements to use the ansible
k8s module.


#### Developing Workshop

##### Using Containers (Recommended)

In order to test and develop on your local machine, you can use a specially built container with Podman or Docker as follows.

[source,sh]
----
podman run --rm --name antora -v $PWD:/antora -p 8080:8080 -i -t ghcr.io/juliaaano/antora-viewer
----

Live-reload is not supported.

##### Using Local Files (Less Recommended)

. Create a git repo from this template
. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
. Run ./utilities/lab-serve
. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
. Run ./utilities/lab-build to build your html

To rebuild your html, run `./utilites/build`.

#### Understanding the Basic Template Directory Structure

[source,sh]
----
./content/modules/ROOT/
├── assets
│   └── images                       # Images used in your content
│       └── example-image.png
├── examples                         # You can add downloadable assets here
│   └── example-bash-script.sh       # e.g. an example bash script
├── nav.adoc                         # Navigation for your lab
├── pages                            # Your content goes here
│   ├── index.adoc                   # First page of your lab, e.g. overview etc
│   ├── module-01.adoc
│   └── module-02.adoc               # Sample lab has 2 modules including index.adoc
└── partials                         # You can add partials here, reusable content inserted inline into your modules
    └── example_partial.adoc

#### Adding Additional Links

You can add links to external content in the convenient "Links" drop-down on the upper-right of the Showroom Summit 2024 UI.

../content/antora.yml
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    page-links:
    - url: https://redhat.com
      text: Red Hat
    - url: https://www.redhat.com/en/summit
      text: Summit
